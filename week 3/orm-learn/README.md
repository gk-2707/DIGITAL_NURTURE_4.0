Spring Data JPA :


In this exercise we are asked to create a spring boot application and connect db to check the retrieval of data.

First we add the dependencies and download the zip file and extract from spring initializer.

Then we add the db requirements in the application properties and connect to the db.

After creating the db we add files that fetch and give the countries name.

Finally, we run the application file and check the output for the countries retrieved from the database.

Output :

countries=[Country [code=IN, name=India], 

Country [code=US, name=United States of America]]
