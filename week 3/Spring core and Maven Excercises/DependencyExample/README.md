
Implementing Dependency Injection :

In this exercise we are asked to update applicationContext.xml to wire BookRepository and BookService.

So we add a Setter method for BookRepository in BookService.

Add the necessary code and run the main file to see the output and verify the wiring of the files.


Output :

Inside BookService
Book info from Repository

Process finished with exit code 0
