#  E-Commerce Product Search

This project demonstrates a simple product search system for an e-commerce platform using Java. It includes both **linear search** and **binary search** to find products by their ID.

##  Features

- Product data stored in arrays
- Search by `productId` using:
  - Linear Search
  - Binary Search
- Comparison of performance and time complexity



### Project Structure
- `Product.java` â€“ Defines the product with attributes like `productId`, `productName`, and `category`
- `SearchDemo.java` â€“ Contains search logic and main method to run

  
##  Time Complexity

| Search Type   | Best Case | Average Case | Worst Case |
|---------------|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| Linear Search | O(1)      | O(n)         | O(n)        |
| Binary Search | O(1)      | O(log n)     | O(log n)    |

> Binary Search is faster but requires sorted data.
