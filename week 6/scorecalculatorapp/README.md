It calculates and displays a student's score percentage based on total marks and goal.

## Work Done

- Set up a React environment with `create-react-app`
- Created a component named **CalculateScore**
- Passed props: `Name`, `School`, `Total`, and `Goal`
- Calculated percentage using custom logic and displayed it
- Styled the component using an external CSS file (`mystyle.css`)
